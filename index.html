      <p>With no end in sight for the conflict in Syria, the world faces a massive influx 
      of displaced citizens fleeing their homes for safety. With their lives in shambles, 
      what can we do to give them a warm welcome to a completely new land that is America?<br>
      
      We at Syrian American Refugee Network, we strive to make the lives of these refugees 
      placed in the South Eastern Michigan area more comfortable by offering services such as
      English tutoring, mentorship programs, legal services, among others. We also host a variety
      of events that shed light onto the vibrant culture of the Syrians.
